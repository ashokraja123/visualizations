# About me:

        # Work: 
                I have been working for Mylan Pharmaceuticals for the last 4 years, my experiance involves SAP, the ERP software, SalesForce, Tableau, Qlik, Power BI, Azure Datalake, Revenue Management software - icontracts& Model N, Price Optimization software used for International Reference pricing etc. 

# What I hope to learn:
                I am not a creative person so dashboards/colors and visuals are difficult for me. I am hoping to put some lean on some logic and rules to improve in this weak area.
