## About me:
>My name is Ashok Raja ( pronounced exactly as it is spelled). I did my undergraduate degreee in Textile Engineering, my MBA in Finance and I am currently pursuing my MS in Business intelligence and Data Analytics from CMU.
I have been working for Mylan Pharmaceuticals for the last 4 years, my experiance involves SAP, the ERP software, SalesForce, Tableau, Qlik, Power BI, Azure Datalake, Revenue Management software - icontracts& Model N, Price Optimization software used for International Reference pricing etc. I am not a creative person so dashboards/colors and visuals are difficult for me. I am hoping to put some lean on some logic and rules to improve in this weak area.
