# Scroll to the bottom to find one where they have not designed it yet. I chose this oen because it was a good article about re-designing some fo the chart The Economist published and now they ahve thought through some previous work and came up with some fresh insights on how best to visualize it. However the last one was not yet re-designed and I thought ti would make a good challenge to try to re-design it. 

#Process: I initially did a wireframe and came up with more of a tabluar form with the different fields on the x-axis and coutries on the y-axis. As for the data in the table I had a few ideas which I drew out: The first one was to put the actual % in it, the second one was to more treat each cell like a bar in a barchart. When I showed my wireframes for feedback to a few colleagues, teh feedback was that there was too much to read with the numbers and for the bar in each cell vertically, it cause a lot of eye travel and they were not able to compare one line to the other easily as there were too many rows compared to columns. In my final design, I tilted the axis to make them horizontal bars and that did the trick. I used datawrapper to build it but I was nto able to manipulate it to get the numbers all outside the color area  into the grey area as you can see below. This chart has less eye travel as it is 5 columsn compared to my wireframe of 12 rows and compared to the original chart, there was too much going on and the overlap of certain bars did not allow each one to be copared easily. Also by putting the nubmers next to each bar the attention was centered around the visualization adn the user cdid not need to search for legends.
