# Topic: India Trade Data- Surplus and Deficit

## An outline:

For this project, I will be exploring the India trade dataset of multiple years. I am going to be showing what is on the increase and whatâ€™s on the decrease and what areas should the country be investing in to improve the economy.
I want to start of by showing the top categories make up import and export and then focus on what areas the country should be investing in to decrease import and increase export. Following, this for the top categories, look at how this has changed over time. The next steps would be on what areas should investment be focused on and what are the upcoming major changes expected to realize this and where there are gaps. The next steps is to focus on the gaps and highlight the call to action.

## The data:

This data contains a list of export and import items by year and their value. This data will show over the years how the export and import mix has changed and what is a major portion of the current export and import and what are growth and decline areas.

## Method and medium:

I will be using Shorthand to create a story board to start at the macro level and using visualizations, slowly work my way down to the specific call to action categories that need attention.
